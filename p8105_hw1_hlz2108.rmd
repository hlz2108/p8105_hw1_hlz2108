# Problem 1
The data chunk below creates a data frame comprised of:
* a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
* a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
* a character vector of length 10
* a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
```{r Problem_1}
library(tidyverse)

p1_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  samp_pos = samp > 0,
  samp_char = character(length = 10),
  samp_factor = factor ((1:10), levels = c((0, 1, 2)))
)
```


This code chunk applies the _as.numeric_ function to the logical, character, and factor variables.
```{r As_Numeric eval = FALSE}

```


```{r}


```

# Problem 2
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

The variables in the dataset are `r v`.?
The number of rows in the dataset is `r nrow`.
The number of columns in the dataset is `r ncol`.
The mean flipper length is `r mean(flipper_length_mm)`.
